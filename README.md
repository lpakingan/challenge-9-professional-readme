  ## Installation <a name ='installation'></a>
  The user must have node.js, npm and inquirer packages installed in order to utilize the generator.

  ## Usage <a name ='usage'></a>
  When you are in the folder of the 'index.js' file of the generator, you can access it by typing in 'node index.js' in the command line of the terminal. The user will then be given prompts about what information they would like to include into their README file. Once all prompts have been answered, the user is generated a personalized README file based on their responses.
